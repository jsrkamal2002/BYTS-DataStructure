- OverFlow - Trying to push element over the Limit of stack.

- UnderFlow - Trying to Pop element from the empty stack.

### Assigment

1. Disavdantage of stack in unorganized data
1. Is Stack data structure Perment?
1. Can I create a Stack dynamically? If so how?
1. Is FILO is same as LIFO?
1. How stack are used in Operating System?

### Stack Implementation
